  In Go, the convention is to "er" a type to indicate that it is an interface. Shape is best named Shaper when it is an interface. Convert is best named Converter when it is an interface. Not doing so wonâ€™t crash your program but it is useful to follow convention as it will be easier for others reading the code to understand what is intended.
